# techDegree_FEWD_Project1
 This is the first project for the Front End Web Developer Tech Degree
 index.html, contact.html, experience.html & style.css have been validate on W3C
 All pages of the site have been checked in firefox, chrome and edge.
 When navigating between pages in chrome, the "cards" are moving as the page loads.
 I'm not sure what is causing this, but don't it is relevant for this project.
